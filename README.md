# Face-Mask-Detection

The project uses transfer learning with mobileNet V2 (weights pretrained on 'imagenet'), along with openCV and haar-cascade frontal face classifier to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The project helps enforce an important precautionary measure in these pandemic ridden times by alerting the neccery personnel on identifying a person without a mask.

## Implementation:

To implement the project, simply download the weights, the classifier and the python notebook and run the FaceMask-Detection.ipynb file. The comments in the file make it easily readable!
